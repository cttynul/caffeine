Are you tired of your Windows PC dozing off when you need it most? Does your ~~status on Teams, Slack, or Webex keep turning "away" while you're just deep in thought or~~ PC go to sleep when grabbing another coffee?? **Caffeine** is here to keep your PC wide awake and your status forever green!

Caffeine is a simple yet effective script that prevents your Windows machine from going to sleep. No more fiddling with power settings or jiggling your mouse every few minutes.

## Disclaimer

Now, a tiny, almost imperceptible disclaimer, whispered softly like a secret between friends: I take absolutely no responsibility if, by some twisted turn of fate, you're violating some obscure, arcane policy with this software. Because, let's be honest, if you've made it this far, past the initial setup screens and through the labyrinthine layers of IT bureaucracy, it's entirely possible that changing this particular setting isn't even an option in your PC's settings. You're probably in a situation where the only way out is through, or, you know, a strongly worded email to IT that will inevitably be ignored.

So, go forth, compile your hearts out, and may your executables run ever so smoothly. Just don't blame me when the corporate overlords discover your ingenious workaround. I'm just here to provide the chuckles and the occasional, entirely unhelpful, advice.

## How It Works

Caffeine's secret is delightfully simple: it **simulates a keyboard key press every minute.** Don't worry, it's not pressing `Shift` or `Space` and messing up your work. Instead, it presses an **"unassigned" virtual key** that Windows recognizes as activity, but doesn't actually do anything in your applications. This clever trick keeps your system active, preventing it from entering sleep mode due to inactivity.

## Versions Available

We've got Caffeine brewing in a few different flavors to suit your preference:

### PowerShell Version (Recommended)

This is the **recommended** version for most Windows users. It's easy to run, integrates well with the system, and doesn't require any extra installations if you have PowerShell (which you do!).

### Python Version (Recommended)

If you're a Python enthusiast, this version is for you! It offers cross-platform potential (though currently focused on Windows) and is easy to modify if you want to tweak its behavior. You'll need a Python installation to run this.

### Visual Basic.NET Version (Historical - Use with Caution!)

For historical reasons, the original Visual Basic .NET version is still included. However, we **strongly advise against using it.** This code is likely very old, probably "spaghetti code," and potentially quite terrible to maintain or even run safely. It's more of a relic than a recommendation!

# Installation & Usage

## Quick stealth setup
Follow these simple steps to install **Caffeine** on your system:

1.  Download `Install.ps1` file and save it to a folder of your choice.
    ```powershell
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cttynul/caffeine/refs/heads/master/Powershell/Install.ps1" -OutFile (Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath "Install.ps1")
    ```
2.  Run the script:
    ```powershell
    .\Install.ps1
    ```
3. Open Powershell everytime you want a coffee and wait for magic.

## How stealth setup works
1. The installer script `Install.ps1` performs the following steps:
2. Downloads last `Caffeine.ps1` from this repository.
3. Checks if your PowerShell profile file (`$profile`) exists. If not, it creates it.
4. Adds a command to the profile to start `Caffeine.ps1` as a background process using `Start-Process`.

## PowerShell

1.  **Download:** Grab the `Caffeine.ps1` file from this repository.
    ```powershell
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cttynul/caffeine/refs/heads/master/Powershell/Caffeine.ps1" -OutFile (Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath "Caffeine.ps1")
    ```
2.  **Run:** Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then run:
    ```powershell
    .\Caffeine.ps1
    ```
3.  **Optional:** If you want to set a timeout different then the default one (60 secons) run:
    ```powershell
    .\Caffeine.ps1 -Wait 120 #120 seconds
    ```
**Note:** *You may not have permission to run Powershell or they could be restricted by your admin so you could set execution policy for current user with* `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser`.

## Python

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  **Download:** Get the `caffeine.py` file.
    ```powershell
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cttynul/caffeine/refs/heads/master/Python/caffeine.py" -OutFile (Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath "caffeine.py")
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:** You might need `pywin32` for Windows-specific keypresses. Install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pywin32
    ```
4.  **Run:** Open Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to the file's directory, and run:
    ```bash
    python caffeine.py
    ```
5.  **Optional:** If you want to set a timeout different then the default one (60 secons) run:
    ```bash
    python caffeine.py -t 120 #120 seconds, can be used both -t and --time
    ```

## Why not a an .exe or similar?
Alright, let's get down to brass tacks, or should I say, compiled bytes. You're wondering why not just stick to a good old .exe or something equally, well, executable? And frankly, it's a stellar question, much like asking why we still haven't achieved teleportation when clearly, it's the superior mode of travel.

Here's the deal: if your laptop is happily chugging along with `powershell.exe` or `python.exe` doing its thing, the chances of someone "accidentally" unleashing a nefarious trigger are, shall we say, astronomically low. We're talking "finding a unicorn riding a skateboard" levels of improbability. These are the workhorses, the unsung heroes, the digital equivalent of that one friend who always brings a spare phone charger. They're meant to be there, doing their job, not secretly plotting world domination (at least, not yet).

Preamble
Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the consequences for our society and planet.
As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.
We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature, and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all society.
We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that vision further from reach.
